    <string name="about_text_intro">Record your life events with time and locations simply with a touch on the screen.
        Easily add detailed notes and photos for any event.  Analyze your past events in various ways with charts and maps.
        Photos are shrunk to the size of 500 pixels and compressed with Jpeg quality of 60, resulting in reduced sizes around 70KB each.
        Photos are stored under the dedicated folder of the app, so other apps can\'t access them. </string>
